# Structured Output

In many use cases, you may want the LLM to output a specific structure, such as a list or a dictionary with predefined keys.

There are several approaches to achieve a structured output:
- **Prompting** the LLM to strictly return a defined structure.
- Using LLMs that natively support **schema enforcement**.
- **Post-processing** the LLM's response to extract structured content.

In practice, **Prompting** is simple and reliable for modern LLMs.

### Example Use Cases

- Extracting Key Information 

```yaml
product:
  name: Widget Pro
  price: 199.99
  description: |
    A high-quality widget designed for professionals.
    Recommended for advanced users.
```

- Summarizing Documents into Bullet Points

```yaml
summary:
  - This product is easy to use.
  - It is cost-effective.
  - Suitable for all skill levels.
```

- Generating Configuration Files

```yaml
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  ssl: true
```

## Prompt Engineering

When prompting the LLM to produce **structured** output:
1. **Wrap** the structure in code fences (e.g., `yaml`).
2. **Validate** that all required fields exist (and let `Node` handle retries).

### Example Text Summarization

```typescript
class SummarizeNode extends Node {
  exec(prepRes: string): Record<string, any> {
    // Suppose `prepRes` is the text to summarize.
    const prompt = `
Please summarize the following text as YAML, with exactly 3 bullet points

${prepRes}

Now, output:
```yaml
summary:
  - bullet 1
  - bullet 2
  - bullet 3
```";
    const response = callLLM(prompt);
    const yamlStr = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].trim();

    const structuredResult = YAML.parse(yamlStr);

    if (!structuredResult.summary || !Array.isArray(structuredResult.summary)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid structured result: Missing or invalid 'summary'");
    }

    return structuredResult;
  }
}
```

> Besides using validation checks, another popular way to validate schemas is [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) or similar libraries in TypeScript.

### Why YAML instead of JSON?

Current LLMs struggle with escaping. YAML is easier with strings since they don't always need quotes.

**In JSON**  

```json
{
  "dialogue": "Alice said: \"Hello Bob.\\nHow are you?\\nI am good.\""
}
```

- Every double quote inside the string must be escaped with `\"`.
- Each newline in the dialogue must be represented as `\n`.

**In YAML**  

```yaml
dialogue: |
  Alice said: "Hello Bob.
  How are you?
  I am good."
```

- No need to escape interior quotesâ€”just place the entire text under a block literal (`|`).
- Newlines are naturally preserved without needing `\n`.
